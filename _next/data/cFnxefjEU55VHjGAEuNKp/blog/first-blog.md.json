As you scroll down you will notice all the parallax events and the little design cookies. All important parts are well highlighted and easily accessible. It's as I call a ZEN design .\n\nThe blog page is truly designed under the goal to limit the clicks number to reach the sought post.\n\n## Result\n\n![Blog Design image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1656452509/porftolio_design_ea4539074b.png)\n\n\n## Development\n\n### Chosen Stack\n\n* NextJS\n* Chakra UI \n* Framer motion\n* Strapi CMS\n\n## Final words\n\nIt was a very fun experience building my own digital portfolio and blog. One year ago, in a such a day I started learning web development . Seeing how far I did come, how I did improve with each finished project with each feedback I get ,  It all gives me the motivation and the confidence to improve further either in this field or any other.\n\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
