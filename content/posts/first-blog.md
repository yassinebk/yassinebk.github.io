# Design Process 

## Inspiration:

During the winter's holidays, I have finally found time to watch the Dune movie and from there I got my inspiration.

## UI

### Colors

As you can see, the website palette was totally inspired from this picture which was both a challenge and a joy as these cold colors gives a professional vibe to the website and allowed me to go for a cyber theme. 

### Typography

- Main font : **Iceland**
- Special font : **Inversionz Unboxed**
* Post text font : **Sen**   *a font more comfortable to read*


## UX

The main page, was meant to be like a journey. As you scroll down you will notice all the parallax events and the little design cookies. All important parts are well highlighted and easily accessible. It's as I call a ZEN design .

The blog page is truly designed under the goal to limit the clicks number to reach the sought post.

## Result

## Development

### Chosen Stack

* NextJS
* Chakra UI 
* Framer motion
* Strapi CMS

## Final words

It was a very fun experience building my own digital portfolio and blog. One year ago, in a such a day I started learning web development . Seeing how far I did come, how I did improve with each finished project with each feedback I get ,  It all gives me the motivation and the confidence to improve further either in this field or any other.
